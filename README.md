Welcome to the Protocol Improvement Proposal (SNS-IP) Repository! This is the place where we discuss, collaborate on, and track the progress of SNS-IPs.
</p>

<br />
<h2 align="center">What is a Protocol Improvement Proposal (SNS-IP)?</h2>
<br />

A Protocol Improvement Proposal (SNS-IP) is a design document that describes a new feature or improvement for a protocol. It provides a concise technical specification of the feature and the rationale for the proposed change.

<br />
<h2 align="center">How to Submit a SNS-IP</h2>
<br />

1. **Fork the repository**: Click the 'Fork' button at the top right of this page and clone your forked repository to your local machine.

2. **Create your SNS-IP**: Use the provided SNS-IP [template](TEMPLATE.md) and fill it out completely. Save it as a Markdown file.

3. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: Submit a new PR to this repository with your SNS-IP. Please ensure your SNS-IP is named correctly and is placed in the correct directory.

Your SNS-IP will be reviewed by the maintainers and the community. Comments, questions, and changes may be discussed on the PR.

<h2 align="center">Contributing</h2>
<br />

We greatly value community participation in our project.
To begin contributing, we ask you first to familiarize yourself with our SNS-IP process.
Once you've done this, the first step in proposing changes is to open an issue for discussion.
Then, clearly outline your suggested changes and ideas for our community to review and discuss.
After thorough discussion, it might be decided to proceed to the next step and assign a member of the community or a maintainer to submit a first draft SNS-IP via a pull request.
If you are assigned this task, please ensure that your proposal is comprehensive and well-articulated prior to submission.
Once the SNS-IP draft has been submitted via a pull request, both maintainers and the community will review it, potentially proposing amendments or enhancements, or even sometimes deferring or rejecting the proposal entirely.

If and when satisfactory consensus has been reached, the SNS-IP proposal will be finalized and integrated into the SNS protocol itself.
